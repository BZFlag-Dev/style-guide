This is BZFlag's official front-end framework used for a consistent look and feel across official project websites; think Bootstrap but stylized and built specifically for the project.

The project is built with Sass and vanilla JavaScript to reduce the amount of dependencies needed to use this framework. The goal of this project is contain generic components that will work across all our websites but not specific components that will only be used in a single site.
